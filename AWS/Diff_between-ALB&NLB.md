# **Differences between Application Load Balancer & Network Load Balancer**
Here are the key differences between **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in simple terms:  

### **1. OSI Layer:**  
- **ALB** works at **Layer 7** (Application Layer) → It understands HTTP/HTTPS requests.  
- **NLB** works at **Layer 4** (Transport Layer) → It routes based on IP and TCP/UDP connections.  

### **2. Routing Type:**  
- **ALB** routes traffic based on content (e.g., URL path, headers, cookies).  
- **NLB** routes traffic based on IP addresses and ports.  

### **3. Performance:**  
- **ALB** is better for complex request processing (e.g., API gateways, microservices).  
- **NLB** is faster and handles millions of requests per second with low latency.  

### **4. Protocols Supported:**  
- **ALB** supports HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSockets.  
- **NLB** supports TCP, UDP, and TLS connections.  

### **5. Target Type:**  
- **ALB** forwards traffic to EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions.  
- **NLB** forwards traffic to EC2 instances or private IPs (including on-premises servers).  

### **6. Health Checks:**  
- **ALB** performs health checks at the application level (e.g., HTTP response codes).  
- **NLB** performs health checks at the network level (e.g., TCP connections).  

### **7. Use Cases:**  
- **ALB** is ideal for websites, web applications, and microservices.  
- **NLB** is best for gaming, real-time applications, and financial systems.

Here’s a **comparison table** for better visualization:  

| Feature                 | Application Load Balancer (ALB) | Network Load Balancer (NLB) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **OSI Layer**          | Layer 7 (Application Layer)   | Layer 4 (Transport Layer)  |
| **Routing Type**       | Based on URL, headers, cookies | Based on IP and port       |
| **Performance**        | Handles complex logic, slower | Very fast, low latency     |
| **Protocols Supported**| HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets       | TCP, UDP, TLS              |
| **Target Type**        | EC2, containers, Lambda       | EC2, private IPs           |
| **Health Checks**      | HTTP-level (response codes)   | Network-level (TCP checks) |
| **Best Use Cases**     | Websites, APIs, microservices | Gaming, real-time apps, financial services |

In an interview, we can answer like this:  

**"Application Load Balancer (ALB) works at Layer 7(Application layer) of the OSI model, meaning it routes traffic based on content like URLs, headers, and cookies. It is best for websites, APIs, and microservices that need smart routing.**  

**Network Load Balancer (NLB) works at Layer 4(Transport layer), meaning it routes traffic based on IP and port. It is designed for high-performance applications like gaming, financial transactions.**  

**ALB supports HTTP and HTTPS, while NLB supports TCP, UDP, and TLS. ALB checks application health based on HTTP responses, while NLB does basic network-level health checks. ALB is smarter, while NLB is faster."**
