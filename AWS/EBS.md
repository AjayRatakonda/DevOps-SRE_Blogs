### **What is EBS in AWS?**  

**EBS (Elastic Block Store)** is **a storage service in AWS** that provides **persistent storage for EC2 instances**.  

### **Simple Explanation**  
- Think of **EBS as a hard drive** that you can attach to your **EC2 server**.  
- Even if you **stop or restart** the EC2 instance, the **EBS volume keeps the data**.  
- You can **increase size, take backups (snapshots), and move it between servers**.  

### **Key Features of EBS**  
- **Persistent Storage** → Data is saved even if the EC2 instance stops.  
- **Attach & Detach** → You can connect EBS to any EC2 instance.  
- **Snapshots** → Take backups of data and restore anytime.  
- **Scalable** → Increase the size of the volume without data loss.  
- **Different Types** → Choose based on performance needs (`gp3`, `io2`, `st1`, etc.).  

### **Example Use Case**  
- If you run a **database on EC2**, you store data on **EBS**, so it remains safe even if the server restarts.  

# **Managing EBS Volumes and Snapshots in AWS**  

1. **Attaching an EBS volume to a server**  
2. **Taking a snapshot of an EBS volume**  
3. **Creating a new volume from a snapshot**  
4. **Attaching the new volume to another server**

## **Step 1: Create and Attach an EBS Volume to a Server**  

1. **Go to AWS Console** → **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. create one ec2 instance (t2.micro)

3. In the left panel, click **"Volumes"** under **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**.  
4. Click **"Create Volume"**.

5. Select the following options:  
   - **Size:** Enter the required size (e.g., 1 GiB).  
   - **Volume Type:** Choose **gp2** (General Purpose SSD).  
   - **Availability Zone (AZ):** Select the **same AZ**(ap-south-1b) as your EC2 instance.  
6. Click **"Create Volume"**.

7. Once created, **attach it to an instance**:  
   - Select the volume.  
   - Click **"Actions"** → **"Attach Volume"**.  
   - Select the EC2 instance.  
   - Enter a **device name** (e.g., `/dev/sdf`).  
   - Click **"Attach Volume"**.

### **Verify the Volume on the EC2 Instance**
1. Connect to the instance via SSH:  
   ```sh
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<instance-ip>
   ```
2. Check if the volume is attached:  
   ```sh
   lsblk
   ```

4. Format and mount the volume:  
   ```sh
   sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9426f8f3-0564-4555-9268-f6c1a92ee8c3)

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/newvolume
   ```
   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/newvolume
   ```
   
5. Verify the volume is mounted:  
   ```sh
   df -h
   ```

## **Step 2: Take a Snapshot of the EBS Volume**
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Volumes**.  
2. Select the **EBS volume** you want to back up.  
3. Click **"Actions"** → **"Create Snapshot"**.  
4. Enter a **name/description** (e.g., `my-snapshot`).  
5. Click **"Create Snapshot"**.  
6. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Snapshots** to verify the snapshot is created.

## **Step 3: Create a New Volume from a Snapshot**
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Snapshots**.  
2. Select the snapshot you created.  
3. Click **"Actions"** → **"Create Volume"**.  
4. Select the following options:  
   - **Size:** Keep the same or increase.  
   - **Volume Type:** Choose **gp2**.  
   - **Availability Zone:** Choose the same AZ as the new EC2 instance.  
5. Click **"Create Volume"**.

## **Step 4: Attach the New Volume to Another Server**
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → **Volumes**.  
2. Select the new volume created from the snapshot.  
3. Click **"Actions"** → **"Attach Volume"**.  
4. Choose the **new EC2 instance** where you want to attach it.  
5. Enter a **device name** (e.g., `/dev/xvdg`).  
6. Click **"Attach Volume"**.

### **Verify and Mount the New Volume on the New Server**
1. Connect to the new instance via SSH:  
   ```sh
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<new-instance-ip>
   ```
2. Check if the volume is detected:  
   ```sh
   lsblk
   ```
   Example output:  
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698e9258-88cc-4412-a919-de67e7b6bebc)

   ```
3. Mount the volume:  
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/restoredvolume
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/restoredvolume
   ```
4. Verify the volume contents:  
   ```sh
   ls /mnt/restoredvolume
   ```
   If only lost+found appears, the snapshot may have been empty.

   If the original data is intact, the snapshot restoration is successful.
